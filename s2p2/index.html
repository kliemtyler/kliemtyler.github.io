                    <figcaption>If I told you that a Jersey diner made its way to Paris, you’d have no choice but to believe me. <br><br> Once sitting along the stretch of Route 1 and Quakerbridge Road in Princeton, N.J., the Clarksville Diner, née Princeton Grill, stands wielding on the Seine, only a 10-minute drive to the Eiffel Tower. As if a scene from<span><em>Up</em></span>, the 1930s-era chrome building looks wrong, tucking itself between the sprawling skyscrapers of the Boulogne-Billancourt business district. Its life as a restaurant in the throes of the Northeast has long met its end. <br><br> Before making its way to Paris, it ended up in Decorah, Iowa, pictured here in a vintage postcard.</figcaption>

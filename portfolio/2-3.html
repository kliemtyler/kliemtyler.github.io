        <div class="regular_large">I think it's important to consider that the programming and design worlds, as Nasser posits, are both Latin script-centric and inherently discriminatory to non-Latin scripts, especially right-to-left scripts. As someone who renders design work in Yiddish, a right-to-left script, I've seen first-hand what Nasser calls "butchered" typesetting, where the right-to-left script is rendered left-to-right instead, due to the fault of the unfamiliar designer. In thinking of the inclusivity of programming, perhaps the first step is introducing programmers and designers to non-Latin scriptsâ€”or, at the very least, how they operate in digital contexts. I've seen type designers usually trained in Latin scripts to familiarize with non-Latin scripts as part of their schooling, especially Arabic. I believe the future would benefit from less ignorance first; and then, maybe, Nasser can invoke what he described as a "global lingua franca" which predisposes programmers to a more accessible way of producing code.</div>

        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">2. If you could envision a "global lingua franca" for programming, what would it necessarily have to entail?</span></div>

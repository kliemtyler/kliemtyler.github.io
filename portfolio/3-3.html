        <div class="regular_large">I like this publication: its ability to weave storytelling on history and computer technologies with the chronological historicization of events that are personal to the story’s characters. I am thinking of the constancy of the website and the ingrained accessibility concerns of the Internet, as well as the emergence of the Internet terms “mainstream” and “alternative,” and whether alternative communities (and technologies) can rectify concerns of inclusion and access. Should the Internet as we know it fall to the wayside, maybe it would only be right to build a new one from a deconstructed model, instead, that incorporates the converging insights of non-developers and marginalized communities.</div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">1. How do you interpret the phrase, “What Else Is There?” Well, what else is there?</span></div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">2. If “community is memory,” how can a community then build and encode the Internet?</span></div>

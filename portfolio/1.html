        <div class="regular_large">Carrión expresses that Mail Art is not yet democratic because of its defined receivership, using the example of 200 expertly decided receivers. In my personal understanding of “mail art” (perhaps not Carrión’s self-indulgent “Mail Art”), I find that the aspect of the post is an order of democratic (artistic) transmission, whether the audience be defined or not. Would it not be so that the mail art created, sent through and manipulated by the post, and then received in all of these various processes renders the mail art part of an algorithmic, democratic apparatus—the function of any (artistic) society?</div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">1. What do you make of Carrión’s claim of Mail Art being necessarily “undemocratic?”</span></div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">2. By what particular service or affect of the post, in your belief, transforms mail into a higher thing—that of the “Mail Art?” What is the body of tools that creates the artistic value?</span></div>

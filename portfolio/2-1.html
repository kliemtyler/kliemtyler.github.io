        <div class="regular_large">I find the idea of alt-text as poetry—or, at the least, a thing that might be able to conform to poeticization—very compelling. On pg. 26: "Poetry has a lot to teach us about paring down language to create something that is expressive, yet concise." For the alt-text writer and user, a co-conversation is created where the goal of expressing an idea must, at times, be interesting but also of a form. Alt-text must be understood, but it can also subject the writer and user to communicate artistically.</div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">1. Can alt-text ever be co-opted unjustly? What might this mean for the alt-text of the future?</span></div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">2. To that end: is alt-text inherently an art? Is alt-text a resource? Is alt-text one of many standards for anti-discriminatory and inclusive practice? Is it all of these things?</span></div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">3. How do we stabilize or increase the use of alt-text, especially for seeing people who interact mostly with other seeing people?</span></div>

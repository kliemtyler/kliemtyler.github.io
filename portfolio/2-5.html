        <div class="regular_large">I'm thinking of the Text being at once divided and united—as Barthes' sign and signified are meshed together in the pursuit of a new graphic design. I am also reminded of Barthes' discussion of the studium and punctum in his essay on photography, where he extrapolates these two graphic ideas: the "studium," which is the objective quality of the image; and the "punctum," which is the quality that "pricks" the viewer. Usually, these two things aren't so collapsible. In thinking of the modernist framework of Gesamtkunstwerk—the total work of art—maybe it is so that photography and graphic ideas, such as in this "hypermodernism," are also meshed together in some pursuit of the new.</div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">1. Can an objective quality of graphic design ever be infused with a quality that is singular to the self?</span></div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">2. Did postmodernism die? Is hypermodernism its replacement?</span></div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">3. If hegemonic and capitalist principles of workflow and media consumption are at play now more than ever before, how might the graphic idea figure in our society, or even our future?</span></div>

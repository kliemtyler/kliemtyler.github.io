        <div class="regular_large">I find U.'s idea of displacing "linear constriction" in the form of creating "personal abstractions" very compelling: reading two or more books at once, engaging with different mediums of inquiry at once, etc. I want to take this idea with me whenever I choose to consume media, especially as someone who enjoys being a media consumer. As Schwulst argues: If the internet is not an "all-encompassing, mysterious, and untouchable thing," then perhaps we can remind ourselves that the internet is a playpen formed out of our interrogations of the world—its stringencies, its conflagrations, its meat. When constructing the web, we must be curious rather than cautious and bring, at the same time, all of our knowledges—our personal abstractions—to the fore, otherwise individual curation is lost in the informational void.</div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">1. To whom do we owe our "personal abstractions?" Are these ideas necessarily for ourselves, or can they be extended to others for the sake of their abstractions, too?</span></div>
        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">2. The internet is versatile because it is a world being created. How do we envision the next 30 years of the internet making a statement or improvement on our lives?</span></div>

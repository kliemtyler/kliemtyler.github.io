        <div class="regular_large">I think that the idea that notions of memory are lost in the digital archive—transposed from the cultural and/or the material—are valid concerns in all new media representations, including the technology and the artwork. I’m struck by this quote from the reading, which I think encapsulates this idea: “ Beyond the indeterminacy of play, there is a pathos—a metaphorical loss of presence—embedded in the substitution of a number, a letter, a word, a name, a sentence, a fragment of a poem, a visual image, a gesture and a sound for fingers and string that catapults the work from a new media realm to a poetics of absence.” Whether in Frenkel’s <span style="font-family:Italic">String Games</span> or another new media experimentation, the purpose seems clear: to interrupt the space between digital and analogue remembering.</div>

        <div class="regular_large"><span style="color: gray">2. What are your concerns with absence, the idea that representations are often fallen to the wayside?</span></div>
